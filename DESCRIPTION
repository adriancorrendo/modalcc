Description: The soiltestcorr-package is designed to assist users on the correlation analysis of crop yield and soil test values. The soiltestcorr package estimates critical soil test values using R several different approaches such as: 1) the modified Arcsine-log calibration curve model originally described by Dyson and Conyers (2013) and modified by Correndo et al. (2017); 2) the graphical Cate & Nelson approach (Cate & Nelson, 1965), 3) the statistical Cate & Nelson approach (Cate & Nelson, 1965), 4) linear-plateau regression, 5) quadratic-plateau regression, and 6) Mitscherlich regression.
