## Description

This tutorial is intended to show how to implement bootstrapping to the `soiltestcorr` functions.

## What is bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping is a technique introduced in late 1970's by Bradley Efron [@efron1979]. It is a general purpose inferential approach that is useful for robust estimations, especially when the distribution of a statistic of quantity of interest is complicated or unknown [@faraway2014]. It provides an alternative to perform confidence statements while relaxing the famous assumption of normality[@efron1993]. The underlying concept of bootstrapping is that the inference about a population parameter or quantity can be modeled by "resampling" the available data.

## How does it work?

Bootstrapping is a resampling technique with replacement. That means that it draws random samples from the original data while maintaining the same original size. Let's suppose that we have a dataset with 100 observations, one per row. Then, we generate 500 resamples, each of them conserving the same number of rows (100) by randomly repeating specific rows of the dataset. Finally, we fit the model of interest as many times as resamples we have. Therefore, we will obtain, for example, 500 estimations of the CSTV.

In general, the larger the number of observation and resamples, the more likely to obtain a representative distribution of the population's quantity of interest. Generally speaking, a minimum recommended number of iterations is `n = 1000`. Nonetheless, this is something that you would like to test on your own until you feel comfortable with the compromise between the quality of the outcomes and the necessary computational power for the iterations.  

Once the distribution is obtained we may obtain a "summary" describing "moments" of the distribution such as the "mean", "median", "standard deviation", "quantiles", etc.. Very frequently, the general procedure is to extract the "median" (which is more robust to outliers than the mean), the 0.025- and 0.975-quantiles from the distribution (equivalent to 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) in order to obtain the famous 95% confidence interval. This interval in normally use to test hypotheses of interest (e.g. comparing groups, methods, etc.)

## The `soiltestcorr::boot_()` functions

You can implement bootstrapping to each of the six soiltestcorr available models, which count with their own boot\_...() function:

-   `boot_mod_alcc()`

-   `boot_cn_1965()`

-   `boot_cn_1971()`

-   `boot_linear_plateau()`

-   `boot_quadratic_plateau()`

-   `boot_mitscherlich()`

Each boot_â€¦() function presents the same basic arguments than their respective original functions (i.e. 'data', 'stv', and 'ry'), with the addition of two arguments related to the resampling: 

- (i) `n`, indicating the number of resamples to perform iterations.

- (ii) `...`, indicating open arguments that allow you to add grouping variable/s (factor or character) for running the bootstrapping by group.


## Example

```{r setup}
library(soiltestcorr)
```

Suggested packages

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Install if needed 
library(ggplot2) # Plots
library(dplyr) # Data wrangling
library(tidyr) # Data wrangling
library(purrr) # Mapping
```

This is a basic example using three different datasets:

### Load data

#### Multiple datasets

```{r warning=T, message=F}
# Example 1. Fake dataset manually created
data_1 <- data.frame("RY"  = c(65,80,85,88,90,94,93,96,97,95,98,100,99,99,100),
                     "STV" = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15))
  
# Example 2. Native fake dataset from soiltestcorr package
data_2 <- soiltestcorr::data_test

data.all <- bind_rows("data_1" = data_1, 
                      "data_2" = data_2,
                      # Create the grouping variable
                      .id = "group_factor")
```

#### Using `boot_mod_alcc()`

If you have groups within your data, you can specify grouping variables as arguments in order to maintain, within each resample, the same proportion of observations than in the original dataset.

This function returns a table with as many rows as the resampling size (n) containing the results for each resample.

```{r warning=T, message=F}
set.seed(123)
boot_alcc <- boot_mod_alcc(data = data.all,
                           stv = STV, ry = RY,
                           target = 90, n = 99, 
                           # Group by id
                           group_factor = group_factor)

# See sample
boot_alcc %>% group_by(group_factor) %>% head(n = 2)

# CSTV Confidence Interval
boot_sum <- boot_alcc %>% 
              group_by(group_factor) %>% 
            # Obtain quantiles of interest
              summarise(q025 = quantile(CSTV, prob = 0.025),
                        median = quantile(CSTV, prob = 0.500),
                        q975 = quantile(CSTV, prob = 0.975))

# Plot
boot_alcc %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = CSTV))+
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = group_factor), color = "grey40", bins = 10)+
  # Draw lines
  geom_vline(data = boot_sum, aes(xintercept = median),
             linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1)+
  geom_vline(data = boot_sum, aes(xintercept = q025),
              linetype = "dotted", linewidth = 0.5)+
  geom_vline(data = boot_sum, aes(xintercept = q975),
              linetype = "dotted", linewidth = 0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~group_factor, scales = "free")

```
